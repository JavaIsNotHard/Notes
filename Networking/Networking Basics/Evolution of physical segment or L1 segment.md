- previously, groups of computer were connected to a shared coaxial cable 
- everything sent by one of the nodes was seen by all other nodes in the segment 
- the nodes were forming a single [[broadcast domain]]
- collision are common in this approach because all nodes sent frames to the same cable

- then twisted cable pairs were used and were connected to a common [[repeater hub]]
- hubs forwarded all incoming frames to every port maintaining the shared medium of the bus

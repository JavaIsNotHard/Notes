The network that physically connects an end system to the first router also known as the [[edge router]]. 

### Accessing network in the enterprise and at home
[[LAN (local area network)]] is used to connect an end system to the edge router in homes and enterprise.
There are various types of [[LAN (local area network)]] but the most used or the most prevailed one is [[ethernet]].
[[ethernet]] uses a twisted pair copper wire to connect to an [[ethernet switch]].
The network of such interconnected switches (or ethernet switch) is then in turn connected into the larger internet.
Another way to accessing network in enterprise and at home is using [[wireless LAN]].

- They are used to transport application layer messages. 
- There are two types of transport layer protocol which includes TCP and UDP.
- TCP provides a [[connection-oriented service]] to its application, it includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control(sender and receiver speed matching).

- UDP provides a connection-less service to its application.

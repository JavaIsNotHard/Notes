The resource needed along the path to provide communication between the end system are reserved for the duration of the communication session between the end system. What does this mean? I have to explain in my own words.

The connection between the two end systems are reserved. Another way to define it would be something like, there is a dedicated path for the connection between two endpoints

Two restaurants 
1 that requires reservation -> we have to book before arriving
1 that does not require reservation -> we do not have to book. This is an analogy for packet-switched connection where to do not 

Telecommunication uses this method of moving data through the network. In telecommunication, a single physical path is dedicated for the connection between two endpoints. In this type of connection a third party connection cannot be present which is polar opposite for what [[Packet switching]] method does where different end system send packets to the same router or destination system and there is not a single dedicated path for packet transmission

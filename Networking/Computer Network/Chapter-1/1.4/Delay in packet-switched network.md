A packet is born in one end system and is transmitted to another end system. We can refer to end systems as nodes. 
As a packet travels from one node to another, the packet suffers from several types of delay at each subsequent nodes along the path. The delays include:

- [[processing delay]]
- [[queuing delay]]
- [[transmission delay]]
- [[propagation delay]]
- [[transmission delay vs propagation delay]]
- [[total nodal delay]]

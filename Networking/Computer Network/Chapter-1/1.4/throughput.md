Amount of data per second that can be transferred. It represents the maximum rate at which a router can forward packets. Let us take two analogy here, the first one is the pipe through which water is transported. Here size of the pipe would be the [[bandwidth]], or the maximum rate at which water can flow through the pipe. The pipe is the network path and the amount of water that flows in the pipe at a particular time is the actual throughput of the pipe.
Another example could be the highway analogy. Suppose the highway has a speed limit of 100km/h. Here 100km/m is the bandwidth or the maximum speed that a vehicle can transport at and the actual speed the vehicles transports at is called its throughput.
The transport layer may guarantee the amount of throughput at some specified rate for an process. This is quite useful for [[bandwidth-sensitive-application]].
There are also [[elastic applications]] that does not have a required throughput at any time. The throughput depends on the amount that is currently available. So we can say elastic applications are flexible in throughput usage.

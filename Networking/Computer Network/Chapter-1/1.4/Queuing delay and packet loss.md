When is a queuing delay large and when is it insignificant? This depends on the following conditions:
- Rate at which traffic (packets) arrives at the queue, which is the transmission rate
- The nature of the arriving packets, do they arrive periodically or do they arrive in a burst.

#todo 
- [ ] investigate more on traffic intensity in respect to queuing delay
- [ ] Understanding how queuing delay works 
- [ ] basically reread unit 1.4 again

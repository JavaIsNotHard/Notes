- We can also view the internet from a different angle, namely as ***an infrastructure that provides services to application***. 
- The applications are said to be **distributed application**since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other.
- Although packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, they are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of data.
- How does one application piece running on one end system instruct the internet to deliver data to another software piece running on another end system?
	-> End systems attached to the internet provide an **socket interface** that specifies how a software piece running on one end system asks the internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination software piece running on another end system

By this time we have to definition of the internet. One is terms of the hardware and the software components that make up the internet and the second one is internet as infrastructure that provides services.

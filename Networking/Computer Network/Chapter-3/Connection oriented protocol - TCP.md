There are various connection various setup during the three way handshake between two hosts
TCP provides process to process multiplexing and demultiplexing 
One of the various setup is called the send buffer where the data from the upper application layer is buffered and tcp grabs chunks of data from this buffer encapsuales the data in TCP header and then send that to the newtork laery. The size of the segmenet created by TCP depends on the MSS (maximum segement size) which depends on MTU (maximum transmission unit)
The receiver has a receive buffer

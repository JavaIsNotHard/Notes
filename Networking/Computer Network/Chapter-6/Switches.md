Link layer device which works with frames rather than individual bits.
The are transparent to all the nodes that are connected to it, i.e the nodes when sending data do not know that the packets are actually first send to the switch before it arrives at the destination. 
Switch performs filtering and forwarding operation 
Switch have buffers similar to routers having buffer. This makes sure that collision do not occur when using switches. 
Switches are self learning meaning that a network administrator need not set the addresses for each nodes that are connected to the switch
Switch contains a forwarding table similar to the routing table a router has. Switch's forwarding table are based on MAC address rather than IP addresses
Switch isolates one link from another i.e if one link has a speed of 10 mbps then it can be connected to another link of 100 mbps or even 1 gbps links.

Physical layer device which acts on individual bits rather than frames
When either 0 or 1 arrives from one interface the hub simply re-creates the bit, boosts the energy strength and transmits the bit onto all the other connected interfaces.
When a collision occurs due to the broadcast nature of the hub, the frames needs to be resend or retransmitted.

All nodes in the channel transfer using its full potential R bps. When there is collision between frames in the channel then the frames are re-transmitted into the channel until there is no collision. 
When collision is detected then the nodes are made to wait for a certain delay before re transmission. The delay a certain node waits is random for each node such that there might not be any further collisions.
This protocol includes the following other protocols:
- [[slotted ALOHA]]
- [[ALOHA]]
- [[CSMA]]

divides the channel into time frames and each time frame is divided into time slots
the time frame should not be confused with link layer frame 
avoids collision 
each link has a dedicated send rate of R/M bps (this is not good) even if the channels is not crowded by other nodes the average rate is stil R/M bps. 
Nodes must wait for their turn to send packets

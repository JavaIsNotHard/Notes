Co-ordination the transfer of frames or packets from multiple nodes in a network to avoid collision is the job of a multiple access protocol 
When there is collision then the bandwidth used to send frames to all the nodes are wasted because the final frames assembled would not make any sense.
The multiple access protocols have 3 categories: 
- [[channel partitioning protocol]]
- [[random access protocol]]
- [[taking turn protocol]]

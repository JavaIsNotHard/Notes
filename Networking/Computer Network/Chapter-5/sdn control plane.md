- We will be referring the sdn control plane's forwarding device as a "packet switch" because the forwarding decision can be made on the basis of network layer source/destination address, link layer source/destination address and other transport, network and link layer header fields
- The sdn enabled control plane has 4 major characteristics which includes:
	- [[flow based forwarding]]
	- [[Separation of data plane and control plane]]
	- [[Network control function]]
	- [[Programmable network]]

- The 3 components of an sdn control place includes: 
	1. [[packet switch]]
	2. [[SDN Controller]]
	3. [[Network Control Application]]

- The packet switch is the hardware component, the SDN controller is the system software and the network control application is an application software.

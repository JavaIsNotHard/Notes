Socket is a software interface between the application process and the transport layer protocol. Socket helps to establish communication between two processes over the network.
Sockets are also seen as an Application Programming Interface (API) through which network application are built upon. 
The API is implemented in the OS level which  means that the application developer needs to call various system calls to use sockets and establish connection between processes.
The mechanism to create a socket includes packet addressing which includes two things:
- [[destination address]]
- [[port number]]

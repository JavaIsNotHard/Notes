HTTP stands for hypertext-transfer protocol which is used widely in the web. Web consists of web pages which itself consists of html files, images, javascript and many more. A base html file is needed which references all the other files and images. This base html file has a URL associated with it. The URL is divided into 2 parts: the hostname and the path.
`http://www.someschool.edu/department/picture.gif`
Here the hostname is `http://www.someschool.edu` which houses the all the resources and the path is `/department/picture.gif`. Here we are asking for a resource called picture.gif which is located in the server identified by the hostname and inside the folder department.
HTTP uses TCP as its transport layer protocol for reliable data transfer. First a TCP connection is established between the client and the server. The client sends HTTP request messages into the socket interface and receives HTTP response from the socket interface. Similarly the server receives HTTP request messages from its socket interface and sends HTTP response from the same socket interface.
HTTP is also known as a [[stateless protocol]] because when a server sends resources to the client, it does not store information about the client. If another request of the same file was done to the server by the same client, few seconds apart, the server would still send the file instead of complaining of redownloding of file.

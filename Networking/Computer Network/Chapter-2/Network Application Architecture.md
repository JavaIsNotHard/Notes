Before writing a network application we need to have a clear understanding of what the application will do and how will it do. This question is answered in the application architecture that we use to implement the application.
Network architecture is different from the application architecture that the application developer creates in order to specify the design of network application in various end systems. There are mainly two architectural paradigms used in modern network applications:
- [[client-server architecture]]
- [[P2P architecture]]

A network application can also have a hybrid architecture where both [[client-server architecture]] and [[P2P architecture]] is used. For example, in a chat application a server can be used to store the IP addresses of the connected hosts whereas the P2P architecture can be used to directly send messages between the users.

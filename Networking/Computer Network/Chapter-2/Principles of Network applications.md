Network applications that we write should run on different end systems and should communicate with other hosts over the internet.
We write network application at the [[Chapter-1/1.5/Application layer|Application layer]] of the network architecture and are not allowed to write software for layers below the [[Chapter-1/1.5/Application layer|Application layer]] because they do not function at the application layer but instead at the lower layers.

## Visibility mode of data members in C++
- private
	When we derive a sub class from the base class then the private members of the base class is definitely not accessible but now the protected and public members of the base class are made private in the sub class which means if we were to inherit another sub-sub class from the sub-class then all the data member of the sub class would inaccessible in the sub-sub-class
	 ```cpp
	 class sub_class : private base_class {
		  data_members
	 }```
- protected 
	When we derive a sub class from the base class as protected then the private member of the base class remain inaccessible, the protected member remain protected but the public member changes to protected.
	```cpp
	class sub_class : protected base_class {
		data_members
	}```
- public
	When we derive a subh class from the base class as public then everything of the base class remains the same in the sub class where the private member of the base class is not accessible to the sub-class.
	```cpp
	class sub_class : public base_class {
		data_members	
	}```
	
## Types of Inheritance
- single -> single base class and single sub class
```cpp
class A {

};

class B : public A {

};
```

- mutliple -> multiple base class and single sub class that inherits from all the base classes
```cpp 
class A {

};

class B {

};

class C : public A, public B {

};
```

- hierarchical  -> single base class and multiple sub class to the same base class
```cpp
class A {

};

class B : public A {

};

class C : public A {

};
```

- multilevel -> single base class, single sub class and a single sub-sub class. Grandparent <- parent <- child.
```cpp
class A {

};

class B : public A {

};

class C : public B {

};
```

- hybrid -> multi-level as well as multiple as well as hierarchical.
```cpp
class A {

};

class B : public A {

};

class C : public A {

};

class D : public B, public C {

};
```

## Constructors in Inheritance
The order of execution of constructor if the derived class's constructor calls the base class constructor then first the base class constructor gets executed then finally the calling constructor.

## Destructors in Inheritance
The order of execution of destructor is the inverse of that of the constructor that means, the derived class are destroyed first then the base class at the very last

## Class relationship:
- inheritance -> 'kind of'
- aggregation -> 'has a'

```cpp
class Employee {

};

class Company {
    private:
        Employee e; // containership
};
```

## Function Overrding 
```cpp
class A {
	pubic:
		void showData() {
			// do task A
		}
};

class B : public A{
	public:
		void showData() {
			// do task B
		}
};

int main() {
	B b;
	b.showData();
	b.A::showData();
	return 0;
}
```

## SRAM (static RAM)
- made up of bistable memory cell 
- each memory cell is implemented using six transistor circuits
- each memory cell can be either in two voltage levels or states
- can be thought of as a pendulum

- the pendulum when it is tilted all the way to the right or to the left are the stable states of the SRAM.
- Any state in between will make the arm of the pendulum fall in either direction
- it can also be in a metastate(where the arm is positioned at vertically) but any disturbance will make if fall 
- even with disturbance the circuit will remain stable when the disturbance is removed


## DRAM (dynamic RAM)
- stores each bit in a capacitor
- each cell consists of a capacitor and a single transistor
- very sensitive to disturbance 
- various sources of leakage causes the DRAM to lose charge every 10 to 100 ms. 
- This is ok because many modern computer operate in clock cycle rate of nanoseconds. 
- each cells need to be refreshed periodically by reading out the data and writing it back.

## Accessing data 
- computer systems have system bus and memory bus. 
- The system bus connects the CPU bus interface to something called as the I/O bridge (this contains the memory controller).
- The memory bus connects the I/O bridge to the DRAM 
- Each component inside a computer system is connected by a common bus and muxes are used to select one component at a time that will either send data or receive data to the common bus.
- the bus transfers address, data as well as control signal generated by the control unit.
- the I/O bridge translates the electric signal from the system bus into memory bus

# IDEAS TO CAPUTRE
- Stack works in first in and last out principle 
- The register %rsp also called as a stack pointer holds the address of top of the stack
- pushing a quad word into the stack first involves decrementing the stack pointer by 8 (since quad word are 8 byte long)
- assuming the topmost of the stack is a quad value then instruction `pushq 8(%rsp), %rdx` will copy the second quad word of the stack or the element below the top of the stack. 
- If %rsp is pointing at the address 0x108, then when we `pushq S` into the stack then it first decrements the value of stack pointer by 8 so now the value of the stack pointer is 0x100, now is when the value is pushed onto the stack. If the value of the source just fills one byte then the remaining bytes are filled with 0's. When we pop the value out of the stack `popq D` then the

TOMORROW's TODO:

MISC:
- Being good at academics
- Being good at music
- Being good at sports
- Being good at art
- My workout split:
	- 3 days cycling & 3 days running
	- leg and vertical workout on 3 of the of above 6 days
	- I will train my upper body only 5 times a week where break will not be consecutive days for example I might workout for 5 days consecutive and rest for 2 days consecutive, this is not good so a better way to do this would be either 3 days consecutive workout and a rest day followed by another 2 days consecutive workout and a rest this way I will probably get enough rest going towards next week.
	- Rest day for upper body workout may have cycling and running as well as leg workout as well.
	- Stretching and warmup exercises early in the morning will be done every day of the week.

# Projects that I really want to do: 
- writing a bittorrent client 
- writing a fintech application that scales and is fast as fuck
- writing a social network using graph data structure (how do you do this? and probably not in django because it hides too much from the developers)
- writing a streaming site (this is going to be the most complex project that I will attempt because I have to learn a lot of things during the implementation of this project)

# Things to do other than academics or programming: 
- learning core concepts of physics 
- learning calculus I & II, linear algebra, statistics I & II, ISL and ESL,

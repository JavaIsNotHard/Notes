# TODO
what are the projects that I would like to build using all the languages that I am learning and have learned: 
- C -> Operating systems, compilers, emulators, Database and other low level stuff like network programming, Linux Programming and such
- C++ -> Bittorrent client, client application, web framework, machine learning algorithm implementation and such
- Python -> Neural Network models, full fledged social media application (like twitter recommendation algorithm)

What I learned today:
- using environment variables to set secret keys such as database password and more. How does this work? So a server is deployed on one machine and that machine will have a env variable for all our secret keys set beforehand.
- Computer architecture -> timing and control signals, block diagram of a hardwired control unit, how timing signals are generated, registers that are common in computers, how registers are connected using a common bus, block diagram of a 16 bit bus connecting all registers including the memory unit of the computer, types of instructions, and instruction set completeness, using control signals in instruction cycles, how instructions are selected using control signals and the use of control function and how they work
- Django -> using env variable to store secret keys, authentication backend, creating a form, basic user authentication

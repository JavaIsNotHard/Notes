# Ideas: 
- LLVM
- Read understanding distributed system book
- Working of indexes in postgresql and full text search in postgresql 
- it also seems that learning AWS is very important (solution architect -> developer associate, learn these topics from either the official aws reading or from stephane mareek course) 
- learning apache kafka from stephane mareek
- completing stats, computer architecture (the programmer's perspective book) & data structures and algorithm (skiena's book, mainly the graph portion & then sedgewicks's tree porition)

# TODO:
## Things to  do in 4th semester: 
- get 3 books from library -> 1. Compute network 2. Theory of computation 3. Operating system
- complete all the assignments and lab work in time because this really saves me a lot of time.
- dedicate 4 hours of the day for studying where 2 hours will be for academics and 2 hours will be for personal projects and learning.
- Always view a topic before it is discussed in class to better understand the topic and have an upperhand over other peers.
- Create proper notes for all subject because you are going to learn a lot in this semester. 

## Things I have to do to get better at the market: 
- network with people through linkedin, facebook groups as well from physical events. 
- get in touch with manoj paju for better mentoring and if possible get a referral to go Germany (this would be awesome).
- I have to have a solid foundation from my CS degree. 

## Things that I want to learn and become: 
- **Software engineering**  (designing and implementing complex application)
- **Devops** (deploying those complex application in real world)
- **System design and architecture** (develop scalable and maintainable application)
- **Computer architecture design** (I want to emulate my own computer from scratch)
- **Game development** (I want to learn graphics in computer, how computer processes images and videos since they belong to computer graphics as well)
- **Computer Security** (this is the only reason i ever wanted to learn computer science so why not)
- **Machine learning and data science** (this seems to be the main hot thing that is going around the world and I am also really interested in developing neural network and working with large data set and getting sensible conclusion out of it)
- **System programming** (operating system, programming languages and such and such)
- **Network Engineer**

## Projects to build 
- real time streaming site
- chat application (both cli and gui)
-  basic kernel and operating system 
- CPU emulator 
- virtual machine 
- programming langauge
- 2d multiplayer game without a game engine 
- bittorrent client 
- window manager and other X11 applications
- application like wireshark to trace network packets
- high frequency trading application 
- terminal and a basic shell and also a text editor (all in opengl except the shell ofcourse)
-

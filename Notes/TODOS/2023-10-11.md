Things that I will probably not learn in college:
- building emulators
- machine learning
- IoT
- building my own CPU
- graphical programming
- system design 
- design patterns
- devops

How will I learn things: 
- The next week will be focused on learning the core concepts of javascript from javascript.info site 
- As well as the linear algebra for machine learning course. 
- 2 hours for both learning javascript and linear algebra should be allocated. 
- After completing the core concepts of javascript I will jump straight into react.js for the frontend development. 
- After completing the linear algebra course, I would like to do the calculus for machine learning from deeplearning.ai as well as from 3blue1brown yt channel.
- If I complete learning react by this holiday then I will move along to creating frontend projects then I will learn django more in depth to integrate both django and react to create sites. 
- I will probably not be able to start the statistics for machine learning course this holiday but will definitely start it during the semester start. 
- After creating some projects in django and react I will learn django-rest-framework to learn API development and RESTapi or django-ninja.

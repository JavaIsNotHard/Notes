I will be learning network programming when I have a solid understanding of networking concepts. For that I need to read books that teach networking concepts like "TCP/IP  illustrated Vol 1" or "Internetworking with TCP/IP" the move on to books like "Unix network programming". This will help me have the basic understanding of how network works and help me create networking applications. Computer networks are taught during my 4th sem.

I want to create as many projects using C as possible. This projects would include things like a a wireshark clone, TCP/IP basic implementing, writing my own kernel and os from scratch, writing my own compiler, writing my own database system (sqlite clone), Writing my own unix terminal emulator and unix shell. Learning machine learning and neural network using C. 

I also want to create as many projects as possible with C++. This includes making 2d and 3d video games. Writing a bittorrent client using qt and libtorrent or my own bittorrent library. Writing a discord bot using C++.

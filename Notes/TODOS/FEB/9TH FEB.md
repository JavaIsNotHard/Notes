Project ideas I have and the knowledge that I would need to implement those projects: 
1. **Unix-Shell**: This could require a deep understanding of how the unix operating system works and how processes are executed in it. This could also require advance knowlege of C language and its various system calls and library functions.
2. **Bittorrent-Client**: This requires understanding of how network works under the hood and being able to implement them yourselves. This also requires the understanding of bittorrent protocols. [Bittorrent Protocol Specifications][https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification]. Also knowing network programming is required. 
3. **Sqlite-Clone**: This would require deep knowledge of how relational and non-relational database are created. And since I would like to implement appliations that would fall on the category of low level application I would probably be happy to implement it using either C/C++.
4. Chat-Application: Understanding deeper concepts of networking and network programming as well as the operating system is required.

The order in which I will be doing by projects:
1. Learning networking and network programming with C and C++. Learning the implementation of sockets and how they work in the higher level using C and using asio a boost library to implement a application that would be using asio with C++.
2. Then I will move on to learn about Xlib and X servers to make a window manager with C as well as C++. I will also try to implement a polybar clone in C++.
3. Then comes Unix programming where I will learn the whole of unix operating system, the syscalls and apis that they provide and then learn about the linux kernel in more depth.
4. Then finally the move to python will be a reality where I will starting learning the basics to the advance topics of python or complete the python course by "Dr.Chunk" on youtube. Then I can move on to Django web framework and database

Things that I learned today:
1. Code: The Hidden Language is probably a good book and I will definitely will give it a try
2. The same goes to Hacking: The Art of Exploitation.
3. I need to be more confident about myself. I need to run 3 times a week and perform plyometrics 3 times a week as well. 
4. Progressive overload or hypertropy where we add weight to increase strength and muscles.
5. I love programming low level stuffs like network programming.
6. I want to buy the agatha christie's book bundle from booksmandala

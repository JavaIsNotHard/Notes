Technical books that I really want to learn:
1. Hacking: The Art of Exploitation
2. Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment
3. Computer System: A Programmer's Perspective
4. Code: The Hidden Language
5. Black Hat Python
6. The Linux Programming Interface
7. Unix Network Programming
8. TCP/IP Illustrated
Since my objective are changing everyday I need to have a list that I really need to be consistent on that I can work on everyday and be proud of myself.
This may or may not be that list:
- Learning more about networking, sockets, network programming, HTTP, working of web browsers and so on.
- Learning one backend language (Python for now) and being fluent in that language
- Understanding more low level stuffs like OS, Unix environment, Computer system, Computer system exploitation
- Making more projects in python, C, C++. Projects in python would include things like a backend application, later on will try on computer vision, machine learning, neural network and so on, web scraping with python,

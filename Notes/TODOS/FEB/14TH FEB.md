So I just realized how behind I was to making an actual progress in the things that I want to be later in my life. For example, watching all the maker videos on youtube has made me realize how fucked up the education system in Nepal really is. The key takeaways from the maker videos that I found:
1. How people from other coutries are just better and smarter than the people of Nepal.
2. How the base eduction of Nepal should not even be considered average comparing them to other countries. 
3. How project oriented students and schools of abroad really are. 
4. The curiosity that they develop from their very young age is just admirable. Making robots and implementing machine learning algorithms before even having a formal eduction of the given topic is just amazing. 
5. That they are far more rich then we are. The equipments that they have are very expensive and cost a lot of money and for the people of Nepal to own the equipments that they own is very rare. 
How can I be like them:
1. It's simple. I don't have to be like them. I just have to be me and be good at the stuff that I like. They liked robotics, electrical engineering from the very childhood and they were brought up in that environment where their parents were also extremely smart and educated. 
2. I just have to be someone that I want to be. 
What what do I want to be:
1. I want to be a computer programmer who knows not only how to create and write software but to properly implement them and write efficient software. I want to learn the making of a computer system from a scratch or making PCBs from scratch. I 
2. I want to be a expert problem solver be it in life or be it in programming.


- Computer architecture (implementing both digital logic and microprocessor as one single entity called a computer). 
- Machine learning, Artifical intelligence, computer vision (writing and implementing various machine learning algorithms to make fun and challenging projects that actually matters or that makes to learn something new)
- Networking (learning how computers communicate with each other i.e socket programming and how data are send over the active connection i.e network protocols)
- System design
- DevOps
- Iot programming (making fun stuffs with ardunio)
- Computer security (hardware security and software security)
- Backend engineering
- Database Engineering

When we really the later half of our career as a software developer we need to consider changing our roles to a product manager, someone who knows how to design software to large scale and efficiently.

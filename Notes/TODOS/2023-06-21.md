Register Responsibilities
Some registers take on special responsibilities during program execution.
• %rax stores the return value
• %rdi stores the first parameter to a function
• %rsi stores the second parameter to a function
• %rdx stores the third parameter to a function
• %rip stores the address of the next instruction to execute
• %rsp stores the address of the current top of the stac

`
- the cpu maintains set of single bit condition code register describing the attributes of the most recent arithmetic or logical operating.
- the first thing we did is we revised stack pushing and popping, the second thing we revised was arithmetic and logical operation in which we discussed about the `leaq` instruction as load effective address along with `incq` and `decq` instruction as increment and decrement. Similarly, we learned about binary operation instructions such as `addq` and `subq` and shift operations like `salq`, `shlq`,`sarq` and `shrq` for left and right shifting respectively. Then finally we learned multiplication and left out division for later discussion

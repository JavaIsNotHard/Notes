Things that I have learned in microprocessor for the last 3 days:
- Chapter 5 (Memory Read Write, I/O Read Write, Interrupts) 
	- memory mapped IO vs IO mapped IO
	- DMA and DMAC 
		- block diagram of 8237 DMAC 
		- internal working of 8237 DMAC and how DMA makes the perpherial devices ready during the DMA operation
		- types of DMA transfers
			- block transfer -> transfer between the memory and IO but the microprocessor does not have the control of any buses which means the microprocessor has be in ideal state
			- cycle stealing -> the bus master alternates between the microprocessor and 8237 DMAC
	- what are interrupts and the types of interrrupts
		- vectored vs non-vectored interrupts
		- software vs hardware interrrupts
		- maskable vs unmaskable interrupts
	- types of hardware interrupts
		- TRAP, RST 7.5, RST 6.5, RST 5.5, INTR
		- the priority level of all interrupts
		- when does the triggering of the interrupt take place
		- which type of interrupt can be masked (disabled) and which type of interrupt cannot be masked
	- what happens when an interrupt occurs and what are the steps that are involved during the processing and handling of the interrupt
	- what ISR are -> they are basically call instruction that are unique to each interrupt send by external device
	- EI and DI (enable all interrupts globally & disable all interrupt globally) instructions and why INTR is different from other interrupts and INTR and INTA'.
	- The working and block diagram of each interrupt pin in detail (the flip flop used to store the interrupts)
	- what are the condition an interrupt must statisfy in order for it to be accepted and serviced
	- SIM and RIM instruction (set interrupt mask and read interrupt mask)
	-

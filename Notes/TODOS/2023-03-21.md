TODO:
- Upto 12 pm I will complete chapter 4 and 5 completely and if possible then complete the revision of chapter 1-3
- Then I will continue towards chapter 6 
- After completing and revision all the chapter I will watch 3blue1brown's videos on all the topics that I learned and the topics that confused me for example what spans are and what basis are.

DONE:
- Completed Chapter 6
- 

LEARNED:
- Co-ordinate system in linear algebra
- What basis and span really are and change of basis
- Gram-schmidt process to find the basis of orthogonal set and QR factorization of a matrix $A = QR$ where A is a $mxn$ matrix, Q is a mxn matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis and R is an upper triangular matrix.
- least square solution => $A^TAx = A^TB$ and least square error => $Ax - b$ 
- Inner product or dot product between two vectors, length between two vectors where $||v|| = \sqrt{v.v}$, distance between two vectors or vectors and space or span or basis whatever where $dist(u, v) = ||u - v||$. 
- Orthogonal set and Orthonormal set and Orthognoal projection => $\hat{y}$ = $\frac{\vec{y}.\vec{v~j}}{\vec{v~j}.\vec{v~j}}.\vec{v~j}$ 

TOMORROW's TODO:
- Since I have completed 80% of the syllabus (can attempt atmost 70 marks during the examination) I can either start revising previous chapters or can learn one more chapter for that extra 5 marks.
- If revision completed tomorrow then move to microprocessor (especially 8085 and 8086)

# TODO:
what are we going to learn and in which pattern:
- Javascript (DOM and networking with js)
- Creating some projects using javascript (scraper, ad blocker, webgl)
- Learning the MERN stack 
- Learn typescript
- This means that I would know python (django) and javascript (express) as well as frontend frameworks like react and vue. 
- The projects that I have been wanting to create includes a live streaming platform, a fully integrated social media platform, high frequency trading system, a personal dashboard and so on.
- After I am comfortable with building applications I will learn devops and learn deployment.
- Then learn some design 
- Looking at the market position of Nepal I definitely have to learn Java and its web frameworks as well as dotnet.
- For personal projects I want to create web api using golang, rust and scala.

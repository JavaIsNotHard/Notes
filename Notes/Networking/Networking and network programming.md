The first thing to know when talking about networking for me is to understand the concept of ISP's and their role during the data transmission between you and the server or the website that you are interacting with. 
ISP (internet service providers) are the communication endpoints between a client (you) and a server (the website that you try to visit). When dealing with network we also need to know the concept of IP(internet protocol) which gives each computer that are connected to the internet a unique address such that the transmission of data is more reliable and accurate. IP's can be considered as a name but represented as decimal or hexadecimal numbers (in computer these numbers are represented by binary numbers). When trying to communicate to another computer over the internet we need to know the address of the destination computer.

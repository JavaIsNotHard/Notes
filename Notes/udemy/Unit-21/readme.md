## How to restore a custom-format dump using pg_restore

We can use pgadmin4 for this task but pgadmin4 is shit and does not work and to fiddle around with all the preferences and settings as a beginner is just a headache that I don't want to live with. So we can just use the command line to do those jobs for us, like creating a dump file or a backup file of the current schema or restoring a dump file that previously existed.

There are two types of polymorphism:
- Compile-time polymorphism
- Runtime polymorphism

**Compile-time polymorphism** happens when we know the type of the function that will be created when we compile the code. For example, we have a function that can have various other forms i.e function templates. When we define what type the template is before the compilation of the program, then we can be sure that the function that comes out after the compilation is of the same type of that of the one that we sepcified.
```cpp
template <typename T>
T max(T a, T b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}
```

**Runtime polymorphism** or **late binding** happens as the name suggests, during the runtime of the program. The main concept here is that runtime polymorphism only occurs when the functions are overriden during runtime. This is possible by the concept of `virutal functions`.

## Use of virtual function
```cpp
class Animal {
	public:
		void print() {
			// print hello world
		}
};

class Dog : public Animal {
	public:
		void print() { // override function
			// print hello world dog
		}
};

class Cow : public Animal {
	public:
		void print() { //override function
			// print hello world cow
		}
};

int main() {
	Animal *pa;
	Animal a;
	Dog d;
	Cow c;

	pa = &a;
	pa.print(); // Hello World

	pa = &d;
	pa.print(); // Hello World

	pa = &c;
	pa.print(); // Hello World
	
}
```

Here even though we have a pointer to different instances of different object the result is all the same. This is because the pointer is the same type of that of the base class. The addresses of the derived classes are only known during the runtime, this means when we say `pa = &d` then it cannot tell the address of d that it is trying to point to so it falls back to pointing to the base object.
This is where virtual function comes to rescue.
```cpp
class Animal {
	public:
		virtual void print() {
			// print hello world
		}
};

class Dog : public Animal {
	public:
		void print() const override { // override function
			// print hello world dog
		}
};

class Cow : public Animal {
	public:
		void print() const override { //override function
			// print hello world cow
		}
};

int main() {
	Animal *pa;
	Animal a;
	Dog d;
	Cow c;

	pa = &a;
	pa.print(); // Hello World

	pa = &d;
	pa.print(); // Hello World Dog

	pa = &c;
	pa.print(); // Hello World Cow
	
}

```

## Abstract classes vs concrete classes
Classes which have **pure virutal function** inside them are called abstract classes and we cannot create a instance of this type of class. They are mostly base classes
Whereas concrete class are mainly sub-classes. They do not have any **pure virtual function** inside them, but they do have overriding function of the virutal in them.

```cpp
class polygon {
	protected:
		int length, breadth;
	public:
		void setValues(int x, int y) {
			length = x;
			breadth = y;
		}
		virtual int area() = 0; // pure virtual function
};
int polygon::area() const { // default implementation when no value are given
	// do something // 
}

class rectange : public polygon {
	public:
		int area() {
			return (length * breadth);
		}
};

class triangle : public polygon {
	public:
		int area() {
			return (length*breadth)/2;
		}
};

```

pure virutal function makes the derived class tell what to return or print.

```cpp
class Animal // This Animal is an abstract base class
{
protected:
    std::string m_name {};
public:
    Animal(const std::string& name) : m_name{ name } {}
    std::string getName() { return m_name; }
    virtual std::string_view speak() const = 0;
    virtual ~Animal() = default;
};

std::string_view Animal::speak() const{
    return "buzz"; // some default implementation
}

class Dragonfly: public Animal {
public:
    Dragonfly(std::string_view name) : Animal{name} {}
    std::string_view speak() const override {
        return Animal::speak();
    }
};

int main()
{
    Dragonfly dfly{"Sally"};
    std::cout << dfly.getName() << " says " << dfly.speak() << '\n';

    return 0;
}

THE OUTPUT IS : Sally says buzz 
```

Using virtual destructor will call the destructor for the derived class rather than the base class.

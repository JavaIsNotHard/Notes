## General rules of Operator Overloading:

## Overloading unary operator(prefix --, ++, postfix --, ++):
```cpp
class x{
	public:
		int value;
		int operator+(x x1, x x2) {
			x x3;
			x3.value = x1.value + x2.value;
			return x3;
		}
}
```

## Overloading binary operator(+, -, /, *, %)

## Explicit Conversion of classes in c++
- Basic to basic (float -> int, int -> double...)
	using `int x = (int)y;` or `int x = static_cast<int>(y);`
- Basic to user-defined(float -> class having feet and inches as its data member)
t user-defiend to user-defined(class having feet and inches as data member -> class having centimeter and meter as its data member)

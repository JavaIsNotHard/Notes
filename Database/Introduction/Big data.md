Big data in contrast to traditional relational databases:
- volume - early parallel databases were designed to work on tens to hundreds of machines in parallel but nowadays more than 1000 machines have to be working in parallel 
- velocity - arrival rate of data in very high which means that ingest and store rate is also very high. Streaming data systems where data needs to be processed as they arrive, in order to detect and respond quickly to certain events 
- Variety - not all data are relational 

We refer to big data as any data-processing that needs a high degree of parallelism whether the data is relational or otherwise

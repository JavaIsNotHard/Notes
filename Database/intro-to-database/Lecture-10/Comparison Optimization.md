comparison between two 32bit or 64bit integers or any other data type is fast because there is an existing CPU instruction that knows how to perform it
we have to somehow optimize the comparison operation that can be used in different types of data types for a really big dataset and we also don't want to reimplement different sorting algorithms for different data types

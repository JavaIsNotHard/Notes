The database consists of various parts which includes 
- **Transport layer** accepting the requests 
- **Query processor** determining the best way to run a query 
- **Execution engine** to carry out the operation 
- **Storage engine**

The storage engine is responsible for storing, retrieving and managing data in the memory and on disk 
Storage engines offer data manipulation APIs, allowing users to perform CRUD operations 

Basically storage manager are their own separate component and database management systems are built on top of the storage engine. 

One can group DBMS into 3 major categories:
- OLTP (online transaction processing)
- OLAP (Online analytical processing)
- HTAP(Hybrid transaction and analytical processing)

There are other ways to classify databases as well which includes: 
- key-value storage 
- relational databases 
- document-oriented databases 
- graph based databases and so on

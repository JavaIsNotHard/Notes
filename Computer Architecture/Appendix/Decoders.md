A logic block that has n-bit inputs and 2^n bit outputs. Based on the bit pattern of the n input bits we select one of the 2^n bit. The selected bit value of the output bit is set to 1 and the rest of the bit value if set to 0. For example, we have a 3bit input decoder which means that it would have 2^3 = 8 bit output bits. Now if the value of the input bits would be something like 010 i.e a decimal of 2 then the third output bit is set to 1.

- The thing is, I still am not capable of writing large projects still. But being able to write project a skill that anyone can acquire. Here are the things that I need to keep in mind while writing my own projects in the future:
	- Don't look up how to create the project that you want to create but start with the basics, for example if you wanted to create a tic-tac-toe gui application in linux the don't look up how to create the application itself but rather how to create a window inside of X11 or wayland(using sdl, opengl, X11, wayland and so on).
	- The thing that can be taken as conclusion is bascially, break the project down into smaller pieces, write functions that you will need, which classes would inherit which class, which libraries to use and so on and on.
	- Make a todo.md or todo.txt file before the start of any project, then write down all the things that you thing should be included inside the todo(the todo will have things that will be implemented in the project). Then you gradually start adding more and more points to the todo. The todo will act as your blueprint for the project.

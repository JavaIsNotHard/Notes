What are the things that I learned during my trek to langtang:
- The locals of the whole tourist area is filled with looters 
- I need to have trekking as a hobby of mine
- Buying trekking gears that are light weight and a trekking bag that is solid and will last long and a 5,6 level moutain bike
- Having accessories like sun screen, hat to avoid burn, moisturizer, face cleanser, extra clothes after taking a bath
- Being more fit for future trekking
- Interacting with people more, not just during trekking but also during daily life.

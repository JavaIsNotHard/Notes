TODO:
- Today is rest day so I will not be doing any workout but radios and plyometrics should be done
- I have changed my focus from flask to django just because the use of flask at a company level is not found too much whereas most of companies that use python as a backend language use django framework to do the task.
- I am also thinking of creating a live streaming site and probably make it public. This site will be something like hotstar or any live streaming platforms like twitch.

What I learned today:
- nginx-rtmp-module helps you create a video streaming server that can be hosted locally or in cloud.
- webrtc help for real time communication using mobile or web applications.

Random thoughts:
- Learning Postgresql (relational database) and mongodb (non-relational database). Bascially learn sql 
- What is the relation of machine learning and data science? Data science involves manipulating, predicting  of data in large scale
- web scraping

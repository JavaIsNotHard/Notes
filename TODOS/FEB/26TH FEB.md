Things that I am currently learning:
1. Python programming (I know the basics of python including data structures, manipulating file content, list slicing, loops). Now I need to create as many projcts as possible using the python standard library as well as external libraries like flask, django, numpy, matplotlib etc.
2. Database Design with sqlite and sql
3. networking and network programming

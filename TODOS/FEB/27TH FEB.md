Today's todo:
- Learning more python
- Taking a bath after fustal
- Going cycling

What I learned today:
1. Python(functional programming tools in python: map, reduce, filter), (list comprehension), (lambda functions and callback functions), (sys.stdout.write(str(x)) to print inside a lambda function), (lambda function inside list comprehension)
2. Watch more TED talk videos
3. So according to tsoding,1 when we download source files and documentation of the file and when we analyze the source code we get an insight of how a particular function is working and now we can actually implement that function in our own code without having to pull dependencies from other libraries. This way we are able to optimize our code more.

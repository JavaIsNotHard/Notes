Things that I learned today:
- Linear Algebra (exercise 6.4 - 6.6) 
- Discrete Mathematics - Started a new chapter "Logic and proof" where we learned about propositions, conjunctions(OR), disjunction(AND), negation(NOT), conditional(if then) and biconditional(if and only if).
- Looked back at "Writing your own shell in C" where I tried and am trying to understand the working of `strtok` function and how it is used to separate a string from a delimiter.
- I am slowly starting to think that I really don't know how to program. I have not created even a single project. I am looking at various resources and articles that people have written on a certain project that I am currently trying to create on my own but am completely failing to do so. I cannot write a single program, I cannot think of any project ideas and any project idea I think of, I cannot implement it. This has been a major issue for me and my development as a programmer and a computer science student. I need to be writing more and more projects.
- I had looked at a site which included data structure of a certain program but don't remember what that program was. My current best guess is a shell but I don't think that is true. (actually found the site that I was looking for, that was a lot of hard work tho, so the name of the site is [this] [2https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Data-Structures.html] and it is related to writing your own shell, pretty neat)

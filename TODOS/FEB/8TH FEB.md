# Thinks that I have realized taday:
- Getting home straight after completion of college hours. (This increases the time that you spend on your home doing something productive atleast, in my case, going somewhere else after college has been one of the major issues that I need to fix right now). The thing is, college hours complete at either 11:30 or 1:30. During the latter I need to reach home by 12:00. By 12:30 I need to have by lunch and by 1:00 I need to be studying. The day college ends at 1:30 I need to be home by 1:30 (because the classes on this day complete earlier than 1:30). I need to by on my study table by 2:00. The conclusion on what I am trying to say is that, I need at least an hour of time allocated for programming or else I will be falling apart each day. As I wrote the other day about how I am not even able to create a single project on my own is because I am not focused on doing so. 
- My goal is to get build at least 2-3 projects that are of industry quality where I will be learning a lot of new things and new technologies. Learn things like Version Control, Project management and many more. I will learn system design, devops etc. 
- I need to take a bath every two days a week or every day I sweat intensly.
- Here are the things that I think I need to improve on myself:
	1. Better self discipline.
	2. Depending less on motivation and more on motive
	3. Stricly following routine
	4. Knowing what is good for me and my future
	5. Knowing what would contribute on a short term progress and what would contribute for long term progress
	6. Growing myself sustinably
	7. Dopamine Detox
	8. Reading books more
	9. Focusing on academics more
	10. Reading news and philosophy daily 
	11. Reading blogs and articles related to programming and computer science
	12. Finding a source of income early in my life


 # What my daily routine needs to have:
1. 2 Hours of programming and learning new things related to programming
2. 1 hour to 1 and half hour of academics studies and revision of class materials.
3. A refreshment time for doing refreshing things. This time should work like a reward for the hard work you put for 3-4 hours
4. 1 Hour time allocation for workout
5. Learning and playing the game of chess.
6. Journalling before going to bed. The journal should where you free write stuff that you think that you accomplished in your day and the things that you could have accomplished in your day and reviewing and creating a plan to improve the next day.
7. 30 mins of hackernews, international news and national news.
8. 10-15 mins of stretching (morning and evening before going for workout)

What are the things that I learned today?
- In College:
	1. Learned about polymorphism and overriding functions in c++
	2. Learnd 8086 microprocessor block diagram.
	3. I don't know what I learnd in Statistics tho.
- In life:
	1. Which friends and people you should be hanging more with and which you shouldn't.

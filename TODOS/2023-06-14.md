I am not genius nor a prodigy nor a natural talent so I need to work hard to reach places that I wish to be at. Will I ever be able to run a company or run a business with the way I am living my life with not hardship no struggle no discipline? No, Absolutely not. I need to focus on my goals, my dreams, my ambition, I need to fulfill what I told myself that I would fulfill. I need to focus on things that are actually important in my life. Now let's take a moment to write down all of my life goals: 
1. Buying a car with my own money
2. Living in an apartment or a colony rather than this shithole of a place that I have to call neighbourhood (no offence to my current house tho)
3. Owning a sports bike (1000cc super bike and a trial bike like royal enfield himalaya)
4. Going on a world tour without having to compromise anything
5. Retiring early (before 40)
Now will I ever be able to achieve any of these goals with the way I am living my life currently? Did I choose the career path that is going to help to earn a lot of money? Is my goal realistic? The answer of all that question would be NO NO and NO

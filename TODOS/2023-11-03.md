TODO (topics that I want to learn):
- computer architecture & linux programming interface
- network programming and networking concepts 
- websocket and creating chat application or anything that requires real time data communication.
- full stack open
- data structures and algorithms (mainly algorithms involving trees and graphs and dynamic programming which are very must used in real world scenario)
- stop overthinking and first complete full stack open from start to the end and once you get a clear idea then thing of other things for now just think about completing full stack open and computer system a programmer's perspective book and also stop giving a damn about how your editor looks, how good your font looks etc etc, you are not begin productive but rather counter counter productive or you are just procastinating.
THINGS:
- How does entrepreneurs think of an idea and what are the first steps that they take to actually build that idea or product that they were thinking about? There must a crucial first step, right? Suppose in the early 2000's, I was Mark Zuckerberg and I had an idea of creating a social media. Of course Facebook wasn't just the only social media at that time but still it was innovative than other platforms that prevailed in those years.

# what are the things that I learned from today's interview? 
- I lack a lot of knowledge in the field of programming
- I need to learn about api and backend more 
- frontend development in nepal is as important as backend development so learning javascript is a must probably
- I need to be humble and gain more knowledge rather than think that no one is better than me. My competition should not be with people who are weaker or less knowledgeable than me but rather people who are equal or better than me. So I need to remove the mentality that since I should not consider the people of the classroom my competitors because there are only a few who I think will really be good

# What are my short term goals that are going to be big for the long term goal 
- attending hackathons and competitive programming competitions
- Building at least 2 projects in django 
- Learning about API 
- Start the `Fundamentals of Database Engineering` course

# What are the things that are really holding me back from being disciplined and consistent
- phones 
- Unmanaged workouts (meaning I spend more time working out and being fit and achieving my real career goal) -> what are the things that I can do to change this? The answer would be to prepare a proper time table 
- evening sleeps (taking a nap for 10-20 mins is not bad but when the time exceeds the normal it becomes time consuming and wasted time) -> What are the things that I can do to change this? Sleep at least 8 hours the day before 
- Lacking immediate results (not being able to hold instant gratification)
- Not being able to retrieve information when studying (when learning technical books or books containing information, the moment the topic that I am studying is hard I feel unmotivated which leads me to fail self discipline)
- spaced repetition

TODO:
- Linear algebra (revise chapters 1-3 & complete chapter 4-5 if possible if not then complete chapter 4) 
- This week will be the conclusion for both linear algebra and microprocessor (8085, 8086, 80286, 80386)
- After the completion of linear algebra (in 4 days min) my next target would be microprocessor (in 3 days)
- Then move on to discrete mathematics (complete within a week)
- Then finally move on to statistics (will only take 3-4 days since I need to revise other subjects as well)
- OOP's revision will be done during the exam breaks so no need to worry about it too much.

TODAY's TODO:
- Exercises of all the chapters and unit learned

DONE:
- Chapter 4 (excluding 4.4 and 4.7) & Chapter 5 (excluding 5.4 and 5.5 requires the concept of both 4.4 and 4.7)
- Revised 1-3 

TOMORROW's TODO:
- will start off with 4.4 and 4.7 then moving on to 5.4 and 5.5.
- will continue to chapter 6 
- revise both the topics

LEARNED (new things, concepts and ideas):
- What are vector spaces and subspaces ->
	Vector spaces which I will represent using V is just a space or a collection of various other vectors inside of it. It can be visualized as a playground where we have grids and a starting position (0, 0). 
	Subspaces as the name suggests are just smaller spaces inside the main vector space. $R^2$ and $R^3$ are two types of vector spaces which are just 2-d and 3-d space. Since a subspace lies inside the vector space there are certain condition a subspace just obey to be a part of of a particular space's subspace which includes:
	- The zero vecotr of V is in $H^2$ 
	- $H$ is closed under addition which means the result of addition of two vectors inside the subspace must be inside the subspace.
	- $H$ is closed under multiplication which means that multiplying the vector with any scalar should produce result inside of the subspace.
- Null space and column space 
- Linear Independence and basis

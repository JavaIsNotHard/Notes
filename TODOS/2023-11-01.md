THINGS LEARNED:
- client-side rendering vs server-side rendering -> client side rendering is just rendering a html backbone and using a js framework to update the ui accordingly. So basically the client sends a request to the server -> the server responds with a barebone html and bundles up all the js files needed. The page is rendered after the bundled js file is completely downloaded. server side rendering is used by django where the entire html page is loaded and is viewable at the same time. They main use templates to load up the html

Project ideas that I really want to try out: 
- Fitness tracker app (includes the total sets and reps that I did that particular day, my goals within the next week, amount of calories that I intake and the amount that I need to be in a caloric deficit, calculating the BMI and so on)
- Music and book library sort of thing (includes the feature to sign in, share your list, adding comments section and recommendation section)
- Chat application (a terminal application that is a cross platform application) and also a web based chat application to integrate database and many other features inside of it such as hashing the messages, securing the database and so on
- online multiplayer game

APIs that a OS must have to deal with processes:
- create: when you type a command in shell or when you press an icon in the desktop then the OS is invoked to create a process to run the program you have indicated.
- destroy: processes are instructions that are going to exit at some point of its execution but a user may want to end a process themselves.
- wait: Waiting for some process to stop running.
- status: Getting information about the process.

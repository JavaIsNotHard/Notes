A process can be in 3 different states in a given time which includes: 
- [[Running State]]: In a running state, the process is running in the processor.
- [[Ready State]]: In ready state, the process is ready to run but for some reason the OS has chosen not to run it.
- [[Blocked State]]: In blocked state, the process has performed some other operation and is not ready to run until some other operation has completed.
There are additional other process state that a process can be in. This depends on the architecture and the Operating System that we use.

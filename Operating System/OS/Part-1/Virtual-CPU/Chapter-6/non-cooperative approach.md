There might be some processes that are faulty by nature or process that run infinitely. In this scenario, how does the operating system regain control of the CPU back?
This is done by setting a [[interrupt timer]]. This means that every few milliseconds the operating system gains control back of the CPU and now can do anything that it wants with the process. 
To handler the interrupt, the hardware needs to save the content of the running process into the kernel stack such that a subsequent call to return-from-trap instruction would return to the previous state of the process correctly.

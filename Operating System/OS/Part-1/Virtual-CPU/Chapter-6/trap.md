A trap instruction is called when a [[Process]] running on [[user mode]] uses [[system call]] to increase its privilege. The instruction jumps to the kernel and raises its privilege to [[kernel mode]]. Doing so will allow processes to perform any kind of restricted operations. Once the necessary operation has been performed then the trap instruction calls another special instruction called [[return-from-trap]].
When trap instruction is executed, the hardware must save the current state of the process, such as the registers used, program counter, flags and more to the [[kernel stack]].

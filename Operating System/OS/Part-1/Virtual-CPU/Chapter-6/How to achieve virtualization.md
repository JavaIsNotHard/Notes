To virtualize the CPU, the Operating system somehow needs to share the physical resources of the CPU with more than one running process. This can be achieve by [[Time sharing]] where a process is ran for some time then another one is ran after some other time. 
There area few challenges that we face while creating virtualization mechanism:
- [[performance]]
- [[control]]
Obtaining high performance while maintaining control is one of the central challenges of building an operating system. To achieve this, we have few techniques that we can use: 
- [[Limited direct execution]]

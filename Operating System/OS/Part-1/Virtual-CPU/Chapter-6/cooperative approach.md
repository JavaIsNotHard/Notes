In old operating system, one way of regaining control back from the process to the operating system was by relying on the process to do so. 
A process transfers the control of the CPU back to the OS many times during the execution of the process while making [[system call]]. During this time, the OS decides whether to perform [[Context switching]] or to let the process continue running.
These systems also include a **yield** system call which does nothing but gives control back to the operating system. 
Process also gives control back to the operating system when they perform illegal instructions such as access memory location that is protected and much more. 
So we can summarize this part by saying that the operating system regains control of the CPU back through either system calls or through the process performing illegal instructions.

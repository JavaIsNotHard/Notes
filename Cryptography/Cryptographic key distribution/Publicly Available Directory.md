The responsibility maintenance and distribution of the public key is given to an trusted authority or organization. 

The authority will store a user's public key as a {key, value} pair where the key is the user identity and the value is their public key 

This approach also has a major flaw i.e if the private key of the authority server is compromised then that user will have access to all key value public key pairs.

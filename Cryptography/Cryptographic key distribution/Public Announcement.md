Since public key are, as the name suggests "public" we can openly announce the public key between users 

This is easy but has a major flaw. The flaw is that the public key can be easily forged i.e one person can easily change the public key and impersonate as that person. This means now the exchange will happen between a user and a foreign entity that forged the public key.

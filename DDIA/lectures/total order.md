two events are said to be totally ordered if A happens before B and B happens A but not both in system i.e either A can happen before B and B can happen before A

for all event pairs in the system, all of them must have some ordering or some casuality between them, this can be achieved using global logical clock as well as lamport clocks with process ID tie-breaker

in total order every pair of events must be comparable

total order in a distributed system can be maintained using total order broadcast protocol

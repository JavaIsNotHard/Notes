basically we are separating both logs and application state in two different regions of the computer.
we want the logs to reside in disk its persistent nature and we want application state to reside in memory 
if we have application state in memory rather than on disk then we get better performance off how we work with the data stored there, we can also store data in different data structure depending on the requirements of the system

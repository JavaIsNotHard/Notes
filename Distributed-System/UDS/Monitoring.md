Monitoring is used to detect failures and to trigger notification to the human operator responsible for the system

another use case of monitoring is to provide a high level overview of the system's health via dashboards 

black-box monitoring was used to report whether a service was up without much visibility of what was going on inside 

white-box monitoring was used to report whether specific features worked as expected such as whether the service was taking up a lot of resources like memory or CPU, what are the write and read throughput of the database and much more that deals with services and what's happening under the hood

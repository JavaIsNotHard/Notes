- short for change root 
- changes the root directory of a process or an OS to a specific location
- docker utilizes chroot by pulling a base filesystem of linux distros like ubuntu or alpine and `chroot`s into the root of that pulled filesystem 
-  only changing the root directory of the container is not enough since the host machine as well as other containers can view and modify things in our chroot only container 
- this is where [[docker/namespace]] come into play

basically is a hierarchical structure that contains a unnamed root at the top

the top branches below the root are called TLDs(top level domains). TLDs include:
1. gTLD (generic TLD) -> used to identify general-purpose domains such as individuals, businesses, or organizations, example include: .com, .org, .gov and more
	1. sponsored gTLDs -> managed by private organization restrictive to certain groups such as .aero, .mobi and more
2. country-code TLD -> country name specific such as .np, .us, .uk and more
3. internationalized country-code TLD
4. infrastructure TLD


the names below the TLD are again partitioned into groups called [[subdomains]]

Fully Qualified Domain Name contains everything from www to . (dot) at the end of the name such as www.example.com.

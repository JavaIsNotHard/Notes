sub divided into 3 categories: 
1. [[channel partitioning protocol]]
2. [[random access protocol]]
3. [[taking turns protocol]]

if we have a broadcast channel rate of R bps then the media access protocol should have the following characterisitics:

1. when one node has to send data then the node has a throughput of R bps
2. when M nodes have to send data then each node has a throughput of R/M bps which is the average rate rather than fixed rate

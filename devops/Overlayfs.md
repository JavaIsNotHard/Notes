- also known as union filesystem 
- divides the filesystem into layers 
- there is a base layer which contains all the necessary information to built the image 
- there are upper layers and lower layers
- lower layers are for read-only while upper layer can be used for both read and write 
- when the process reads, it reads from the upper layer, if the content is not found then it read from the lower below it and so on
- when a process writes, it writes to the upper layer as well
- the lower layer can be thought of as the base layer (in docker the base layer is mainly the OS base filesystem such as ext4)
- any new changes made are made to the upper layer
- layers are used because they are recyclable i.e the same layer can be used for multiple containers such that we do not need duplicated information. For example we can have two containers that have the same base layer i.e OS filesystem
- the merge layer contains merged information between the upper and the lower layer

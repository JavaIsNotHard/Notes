> **Provisioning model** determines how AWS will set up and manage everything needed for your build. Choosing **On-demand** means AWS will create the resources you need for your build only when you start it, and tear them down when the build is done. This is cost-effective and efficient!
> 
> - **Reserved capacity** gives you **dedicated** build resources always at your disposal. It costs more overall but gives you consistent performance and no wait times. Great for teams that are building constantly throughout the day. If **on-demand** is like ordering a taxi, **reserved capacity** is like renting your own car that you can access anytime you need it.

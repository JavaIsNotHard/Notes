- different from EBS volume
- higher I/O performance hardware disk 
- EC2 instance store lose their storage if they're stopped (they are ephemeral)
- risk of data loss due to hardware failure
- have to backup and replicate them as necessary
- Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content
- instance store cannot be created like EBS volume, they are defined during ec2 instance startup
- not all ec2 instance type have instance store

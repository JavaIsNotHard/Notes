### The idea of Infrastructure As Code (IAC)

you write and execute code to define, deploy, update and destroy your application

this makes you treat hardware as writing software rather than working with actual physical devices, this is possible due to the existence of cloud operators

5 broad categories of Infrastructure As Code:
 - [[Ad Hoc scripts]]
 - [[Configuration Management tools]]
 - [[Server templating tool]]
 - [[Orchestration tools]]
 - [[Provisioning tools]]

[[Mutable infrastructure versus immutable infrastructure]]
[[Procedural language versus declarative language]]
